23/08/2024, 19:40 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins is a contact
23/08/2024, 19:40 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Hey this is ryan from physics
23/08/2024, 19:41 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Coherence
12/12/2024, 19:53 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: hey man hope all’s well! just wanted to lyk there’s a holiday party happening at bloomberg tmr evening 5pm, if it’s like last year then there’s gonna be a lot of food and super fancy
13/12/2024, 00:02 - Aswath: Thanks man, if I could get some studying done tomorrow morning, I'll surely make it
13/12/2024, 00:03 - Aswath: How is it going for you ? Everything cool ?
13/12/2024, 01:10 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: yeah ofc! it’s pretty much the biggest party of the year and i genuinely don’t know if other departments do similar things
13/12/2024, 01:11 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: ah you know, finals season, but it’ll be over soon
13/12/2024, 11:45 - Aswath: My department certainly doesn't but some departments did have a dinner i guess. I think the entire engineering school does one.
13/12/2024, 11:45 - Aswath: 🫂
13/12/2024, 12:55 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: damnnn the physics department lowkey goated
13/12/2024, 12:55 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: they’re setting up the tables now
13/12/2024, 12:56 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: but yeah i think i’ve seen engineering school events, they take entire quads
13/12/2024, 12:58 - Aswath: Also, I think the bloomberg building is also one of the biggest for a department
13/12/2024, 12:59 - Aswath: I guess it's only the orientations which take up the entire quads. Most other events happen in the glass pavilion.
13/12/2024, 13:15 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: oh yeah, im pretty sure it’s literally the biggest building on campus
13/12/2024, 13:16 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i see, glass pavilion looks super nice i’ve rarely been there
13/12/2024, 13:52 - Aswath: they host a lot of events, the wse ones, the gro ones
13/12/2024, 13:53 - Aswath: even the gro conducts a lot of events, and they have a ton of funding also
13/12/2024, 13:53 - Aswath: but they're mostly in levering
13/12/2024, 15:44 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: oh that’s excellent
13/12/2024, 15:46 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: do they check if you’re a grad student 🫣
13/12/2024, 15:53 - Aswath: So they have the weekly coffee hours which is pretty open
13/12/2024, 15:54 - Aswath: You must attend some of those next semester
13/12/2024, 15:54 - Aswath: And they have events where they serve alcohol but you have to provide an ID for that
13/12/2024, 16:39 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Yo?! When is it
13/12/2024, 16:39 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Dude I have to
13/12/2024, 16:39 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Oh well, guess I’ll go next year then
13/12/2024, 16:40 - Aswath: its done for this sem 🥲. they have it on tuesdays 10:30 am
13/12/2024, 16:41 - Aswath: sure, i'll let you know when they announce the events for next semester
13/12/2024, 17:27 - Aswath: Hey Ryan, I just got the food. Are you here ?
10/03/2025, 17:36 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: hey man how’s it going?! was wondering if you were still down to hop around the city sometime! especially now that daylight saving is on we’ll have plenty of time in the afternoon
10/03/2025, 17:37 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: also this thursday we have a colloquium given by a nobel laureate. and as usual there will be food. you’re welcome to stop by bloomberg
10/03/2025, 18:50 - Aswath: hey ryan, how have you been. It's pretty hectic for me this semester 😶. Have the most number of courses. There two more midterms this week
10/03/2025, 18:50 - Aswath: Will be here for the entire spring break
10/03/2025, 18:51 - Aswath: We should definitely go somewhere and hangout
10/03/2025, 18:51 - Aswath: You free during the spring break ?
10/03/2025, 21:37 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: dude it’s insane you have more coursework than me 😭 my only midterm is in april and i’ve been doing research most of the time
10/03/2025, 21:37 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i’ll be here the entirety of spring break too
10/03/2025, 21:38 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: hell yeah let’s go somewhere when you’re done with midterms
10/03/2025, 21:39 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: just woke up from a 3 hour nap lmao daylight saving got my head spinning
11/03/2025, 00:56 - Aswath: I just took 4 courses 😶. I'm guessing that you would have more courses than me
11/03/2025, 00:57 - Aswath: yep
11/03/2025, 00:57 - Aswath: similar, had a very full dinner and slept on the couch
11/03/2025, 00:57 - Aswath: waking up now
11/03/2025, 00:57 - Aswath: to go and sleep again
11/03/2025, 10:14 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: No I also have 4 courses lmao started with 5 and dropped one
11/03/2025, 10:14 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Real af
11/03/2025, 10:16 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Are you still going to the Tuesday levering coffee thing? Just saw their ad on instagram
11/03/2025, 10:34 - Aswath: I have a class at the same time 😶
11/03/2025, 11:01 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Rip 💀
11/03/2025, 11:02 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Imma spread the news in the physics department cuz our coffee machine is currently broken so I feel like there would be interest lolll
11/03/2025, 11:56 - Aswath: I don't think the coffee's that great
11/03/2025, 11:57 - Aswath: Imagine Center has passable coffee but you have to be early if you want milk coffee or hot chocolate
11/03/2025, 12:08 - Aswath: more than the coffee it's a place to socialize, but people this semester come in groups and don't talk to new people 😶
11/03/2025, 12:08 - Aswath: but few still do
11/03/2025, 12:08 - Aswath: also they have free coffee at mom's
11/03/2025, 12:26 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i just need that caffeine bro
11/03/2025, 12:26 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: but thats good to know, most ppl probably actually care about the taste
11/03/2025, 12:27 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: imagine center sounds like a lovely place if only it wasn’t so far away from everything… but yeah i really should check it out sometime
11/03/2025, 12:29 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: oh that’s a shame
11/03/2025, 12:30 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: wait like all day? or what time
11/03/2025, 12:33 - Aswath: i think almost all days. I heard about it when i initially came here. then i mostly order groceries online
11/03/2025, 12:34 - Aswath: if you just need the caffeine, then imagine center's a nice place
11/03/2025, 12:34 - Aswath: but isn't it closer to bloomberg than most other building
11/03/2025, 12:39 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: that’s fire dude, btw which platform do you use for online groceries and would you recommend? i was kinda looking into this
11/03/2025, 12:40 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i think you’re right, ig it only feels far for me bc i’ve never been there
11/03/2025, 12:44 - Aswath: i mostly use weee
11/03/2025, 12:45 - Aswath: yeah, it's a nice place but most of the times it's occupied
11/03/2025, 12:48 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: oh sick i’ve used it a couple times too, very different selection of items than american grocery stores, so i used to alternate
11/03/2025, 12:50 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: that would make sense. i like studying in mudd and had to learn its rush hours so that i could avoid those times 😭
11/03/2025, 12:53 - Aswath: so that's primarily a asian app. you have indian, chinese, korean and more asian stuff
11/03/2025, 12:53 - Aswath: for american stuff, walmart would be enough i guess
11/03/2025, 12:54 - Aswath: Bloomberg is a good place to study right ?. I mean it's a huge building and not that many people
11/03/2025, 12:56 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: yeah it’s really nice, a lot of stuff you can’t get elsewhere
11/03/2025, 12:57 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i’ve seen horrendous reviews for walmart online groceries lolll haven’t had the guts to try it
11/03/2025, 12:58 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: everywhere is filled with ppl. or at least everywhere with power outlets. when i study in bloomberg i hijack my grad friends’ offices
11/03/2025, 13:01 - Aswath: oh, i asked a few other people and they said they use walmart
11/03/2025, 13:02 - Aswath: or you could order from instacart
11/03/2025, 13:02 - Aswath: yeah, that's why i mostly study at my house
11/03/2025, 13:03 - Aswath: or my department. my department for some reason isn't crowded
11/03/2025, 13:09 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: oh ok, possibly another case of online reviews being disproportionately crowded with negative ppl then
11/03/2025, 13:10 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: last time i ordered from instacart the service fee was as much as the order itself 💀 granted that’s probably not normal
11/03/2025, 13:11 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: that’s nice, i wish i could focus in my room man
11/03/2025, 13:12 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: wyman park building right? yeah ppl don’t like that building cuz it’s far away and eternally under construction
11/03/2025, 17:18 - Aswath: slept in the afternoon, just waking up 😶
11/03/2025, 17:18 - Aswath: i'm not sure, you could give it a try or two
11/03/2025, 17:18 - Aswath: i thought initially they have free delivery for you to get hooked to the platform
11/03/2025, 17:19 - Aswath: i wasn't able to do so in the last semester, only from this semester i have started
11/03/2025, 17:19 - Aswath: yeah, its pretty far for most people
11/03/2025, 17:20 - Aswath: but for me, as i live in the south, its pretty close to my place
11/03/2025, 17:20 - Aswath: no the building adjacent to the wyman building are under construction, not the wyman itself
11/03/2025, 17:59 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I did not sleep in the afternoon but I can’t say I was awake either
11/03/2025, 18:00 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: They’d still have service fee tho
11/03/2025, 18:01 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Wait if you live in the south, do you go to R house often? Cuz I know I would if I lived nearby I love that place
11/03/2025, 18:03 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Ok my impression of wyman is outdated then. Last time I had to go there it was deeply thoroughly under construction but ig that was a long time ago
11/03/2025, 18:30 - Aswath: I've not been there often. just a couple of times
11/03/2025, 18:30 - Aswath: the building has multiple departments. one for each floor I guess
11/03/2025, 18:31 - Aswath: yeah. I either order or go to giants
11/03/2025, 18:31 - Aswath: I have to be awake in the night. Have studying to do
11/03/2025, 18:56 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Yeah I think when I last went they were renovating the elevators or smth so it was a big whole building situation
11/03/2025, 18:58 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I go to giant usually or streets market right across from where I live when I’m feeling lazy
11/03/2025, 18:58 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Godspeed 😭
11/03/2025, 18:59 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Also bro hear me out: do you wanna go to New York over spring break
11/03/2025, 19:55 - Aswath: hmmm, must be some time. right now it's normalcy
11/03/2025, 19:56 - Aswath: street markets are nice, I've been there once or twice. some of the food there are good
11/03/2025, 19:56 - Aswath: 😂 bro, I went to new york during the winters. this break I just wanna chill and do nothing
11/03/2025, 19:57 - Aswath: because new york is high energy demand place.
11/03/2025, 19:57 - Aswath: and I'm out of budget for the season 😶
11/03/2025, 20:11 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: yeah they have some really cheap and good stuff and then the other one are ridiculously priced lmao
11/03/2025, 20:11 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: lolll fair enough i was just having an impulsive thought
11/03/2025, 20:12 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: coupled with the fact that i’ve been watching how i met your mother
11/03/2025, 20:13 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: ig i just have no idea what im getting myself into bc i’ve never been there
11/03/2025, 20:16 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: ok im sure we can find low budget nearby places to hang out at! i lowkey also need to cut back a bit on spending rn
11/03/2025, 20:23 - Aswath: yeah, I had empanadas the time I went. It was nice
11/03/2025, 20:23 - Aswath: A lot of people are traveling for the break. But all I need is resting and chilling. Semester was exhausting as hell
11/03/2025, 20:23 - Aswath: Haven't watched it yet 😶
11/03/2025, 20:24 - Aswath: It's a cool city. Atleast for touring. Don't know how it is for living
11/03/2025, 20:24 - Aswath: Yeah, and now the evenings are amazing
11/03/2025, 22:31 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: that’s super fair, it’s a much needed mid semester break. for me this has been a chill semester so i’m having a bit of wanderlust
11/03/2025, 22:32 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i watched 3 out of 9 seasons like a year ago and finally got the motivation to pick it up again
11/03/2025, 22:33 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: yeah i imagine not the most pleasant for living…
11/03/2025, 22:35 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: dude ik, actual greatest time of the year imo
11/03/2025, 22:53 - Aswath: aah nice, but if you have the budget, you could do a solo trip somewhere. im completely out of funds to travel
11/03/2025, 22:53 - Aswath: have to start watching some movies during the break. its been some time since i watched one
11/03/2025, 22:53 - Aswath: series, not so eager now
11/03/2025, 22:54 - Aswath: it depends, if you like the hustle then may be ny is for you. but have to give it to baltimore for the friendly people
11/03/2025, 22:54 - Aswath: have to make use of it in the spring break
12/03/2025, 11:06 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: yeah true but i’d much rather travel with a friend tho, somehow the money spending hurts a bit less when it’s with a friend lol
12/03/2025, 11:08 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: my new fav movie is synecdoche new york which i watched like a month ago. instant fav movie of all time
12/03/2025, 11:09 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: for me it’s the way they’re all so long lmaoo i dont have that level of commitment
12/03/2025, 11:09 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: completely agreed
13/03/2025, 01:26 - Aswath: dude, sorry. was busy studying for the midterms. just one more day of torture
13/03/2025, 01:27 - Aswath: its charlie kaufman right ?
13/03/2025, 01:28 - Aswath: yeah, the same. but when you start a good series, then you complete it anyhow and a lot of time just flies
13/03/2025, 01:28 - Aswath: but if the series is not completed, then you lose interest waiting for the coming season
13/03/2025, 01:28 - Aswath: *seasons
13/03/2025, 12:34 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: you’re good dude dw, you got this
13/03/2025, 12:35 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: yes! absolute genuis
13/03/2025, 12:36 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: the movie does give off the vibe of eternal sunshine of a spotless mind which kaufman wrote. but imo it’s more mind blowing
13/03/2025, 12:38 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: right it’s so easy to binge on those series. “just 20 more minutes” and next thing you know you’re 5 episodes in and it’s 1 am
13/03/2025, 12:39 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: actually i watched severance both seasons immediately after it aired. it’s good
13/03/2025, 14:41 - Aswath: just got the exams done
13/03/2025, 14:41 - Aswath: I think I aced both of then, but have to see the result
13/03/2025, 14:42 - Aswath: I started that one but didn't complete it 🥲. Have to
13/03/2025, 14:42 - Aswath: Yeah, I haven't watched a new series for some time but did rewatch some of big bang theory
13/03/2025, 15:14 - Aswath: doesn't the connection go when you have to watch the next season after an year or so
13/03/2025, 19:28 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: lets fucking gooooo
13/03/2025, 19:29 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: ok starting a movie and stopping halfway is something i cannot comprehend
13/03/2025, 19:31 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: im not a huge fan of bbt but it has helped me kill a lot of time on airplanes
13/03/2025, 19:32 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: yes that’s true, i gradually realized that i’d forgotten some of the most important plot points lmaooo but they will drop hints to help you remember
14/03/2025, 00:49 - Aswath: 🥲 even i dont comprehend that. i finish a movie if i start it. but i think i was watching it with some friends, and they didn't like it
14/03/2025, 00:49 - Aswath: same, i like the first 3 seasons, 4-5 are passable and the later seasons are horrible
14/03/2025, 00:50 - Aswath: i love the office, i guess these 2 are the only sitcoms that i've watched
14/03/2025, 00:50 - Aswath: but its not the same right. starting an another season with just completing the previous season is different from just giving hints
14/03/2025, 10:37 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Oh well that makes sense. But who doesn’t enjoy eternal sunshine of the spotless mind 😭
14/03/2025, 10:39 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: The only movie I’ve watched with friends and stopped halfway was the wolf of Wall Street, that shit was SO LONG
14/03/2025, 10:41 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: The office is one of my favorite shows of all time dude! Unoriginal question, have you seen parks and rec? I haven’t finished it but I like it more than the office
14/03/2025, 10:44 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Yeah definitely that’s true. On the other hand the old fashioned way of sitting in front of the screen every week at the same time to watch a new episode air is also a big vibe
14/03/2025, 16:41 - Aswath: aah slept for more than 8 hours after a long time
14/03/2025, 16:41 - Aswath: there are a lot of people who don't like non mainstream movies
14/03/2025, 16:46 - Aswath: dude it's a scorsese film, and pretty good one too
14/03/2025, 16:47 - Aswath: I've not even heard of parks and rec 🥲, but I love the office, steve carell and ricky gervais
14/03/2025, 16:48 - Aswath: I've never done a weekly thing for series. Mostly binged the ones that I liked 😶
15/03/2025, 11:16 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: HUGE W
15/03/2025, 11:17 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: oh ig you’re right, i forgot there’s ppl who’d only watch marvel and stuff…
15/03/2025, 11:20 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: it’s just not for me personally 😭 i need my movies to be emotional. it was a WILD movie tho
15/03/2025, 11:21 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: ppl often compare the office and parks and rec bc they are VERY similar in style, if you love the office you have to check out parks and rec
15/03/2025, 11:22 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: same tbh, though when i was a kid i used to do the weekly thing for nature documentaries. yeah i was a nerd lmao
15/03/2025, 11:25 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i’m gonna take today off and chill at home but otherwise im down to hang anytime, just hmu
16/03/2025, 04:21 - Aswath: dude, i was sleeping and watching movies the whole day
16/03/2025, 04:21 - Aswath: didn't check my phone
16/03/2025, 04:21 - Aswath: just striked me that there's an assignment to complete
16/03/2025, 04:21 - Aswath: so yep, back to normal
16/03/2025, 04:21 - Aswath: they just watch the mainstream stuff
16/03/2025, 04:22 - Aswath: dude, i saw a film just now. its an italian film, its called life is beautiful. highly highly highly recommend
16/03/2025, 04:22 - Aswath: got it, but not for sometime though, have some movies to get done
16/03/2025, 04:23 - Aswath: dude, you're studying physics, you need to say that you're a nerd. its a given
16/03/2025, 04:23 - Aswath: sure, or if you also wanna watch a movie together we could do that. i have a projector at my house
16/03/2025, 11:06 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: That sounds like spring break alright! I also slept a whole bunch
16/03/2025, 11:09 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Nahhhh good luck 😭 I also have an essay to write over the break 😭 if you wanna find a nice coffee shop or smth and grind away for a day I’m down 🥲
16/03/2025, 11:11 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I watch perhaps too little mainstream stuff lol I still haven’t seen star wars 😀 I’m not proud of it
16/03/2025, 11:13 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Bro that film is a masterpiece!! I watched it in the cinema with my parents, all of us were crying by the end
16/03/2025, 11:14 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: 💀
16/03/2025, 11:14 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: You know what, it takes one to know one 🤝
16/03/2025, 11:18 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: That’d be fantastic actually! We can grab some snacks and drinks and do a movie marathon (or just one movie as I often overestimate my energy level lmao)
16/03/2025, 11:20 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Another idea is to head down to the Charles theater not too far away from campus. Tix are $12 for students
16/03/2025, 15:39 - Aswath: Yep, I wanna go to a good coffee shop and just chill. I don't think I could come and grind but should give it a try
16/03/2025, 15:40 - Aswath: No the film I told isn't an art film or something. It's a really good one. Got oscars
16/03/2025, 15:40 - Aswath: Oops didn't read the following message
16/03/2025, 15:40 - Aswath: Yeah it was a masterpiece
16/03/2025, 15:41 - Aswath: 😂 I guess I am a nerd too
16/03/2025, 15:41 - Aswath: Yep
16/03/2025, 15:42 - Aswath: But what movies are they showing now ?
16/03/2025, 16:22 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: we should look around, i heard there’s a lot of good places in hamden and remmington
16/03/2025, 16:23 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: im down anytime
16/03/2025, 16:24 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: <Media omitted>
16/03/2025, 16:25 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I do wanna watch the brutalist and Mickey 17
16/03/2025, 16:34 - Aswath: yea, i could also ask my housemate, he's a phd and he's explored baltimore a bit
16/03/2025, 16:52 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: yeah that sounds awesome!
16/03/2025, 17:33 - Aswath: just have to take care of some stuff in the next 2-3 days
16/03/2025, 17:33 - Aswath: by caligula, is it the anthony jeselnik one ?
16/03/2025, 21:10 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Nope it’s an old movie
16/03/2025, 21:10 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: For sure
17/03/2025, 00:27 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Just finished watching melancholia… it’s a beautiful beautiful movie but as the title suggests, it undid years of therapy for me 🥲
17/03/2025, 00:35 - Aswath: dude, just figured that i have a assignment due tomorrow
17/03/2025, 00:36 - Aswath: these guys do not give me a break
17/03/2025, 00:36 - Aswath: what's the movie about ?
17/03/2025, 00:54 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Oh wtf? Are they supposed to do that??
17/03/2025, 00:55 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Every time this has happened to us we’d ask the prof/TA to postpone the deadline
17/03/2025, 00:55 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: And it’s always worked. You should try it
17/03/2025, 00:58 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Inexplicable melancholy and crippling anxiety (a wedding fallen apart while an asteroid hurtles toward earth)
17/03/2025, 02:48 - Aswath: So I don't have the assignment next week
17/03/2025, 02:48 - Aswath: I thought there wasn't any assignment this week 🥲
17/03/2025, 02:49 - Aswath: I mean, it was posted before. I completely forgot it due to the exams 🥲
17/03/2025, 13:22 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Right, but the week they shouldn’t assign hw on is supposed to be this week 😭
17/03/2025, 13:22 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Spring break assignments are just diabolical
17/03/2025, 13:23 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Rip 🪦 you got this homie
17/03/2025, 13:23 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I’m at R house btw if you wanna swing by
17/03/2025, 13:23 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: It’s really nice out today
17/03/2025, 17:04 - Aswath: Dude sorry sorry sorry
17/03/2025, 17:05 - Aswath: I got the assignment done at 9 am in the morning and then went to sleep
17/03/2025, 17:05 - Aswath: I have to fix my sleep schedule
17/03/2025, 17:05 - Aswath: yeah, but I have a lot of assignments just after the break
17/03/2025, 17:05 - Aswath: I don't think this is a break
17/03/2025, 18:50 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Nah it’s all good dw!
17/03/2025, 18:51 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Not an all nighter 😭😭
17/03/2025, 18:52 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Some days just be like that 😭 you got this
17/03/2025, 18:53 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Oh lord I hate that. I also have things due after the break so it’s basically forcing you to work over break
17/03/2025, 18:53 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I fear that might be the truth 🥲
17/03/2025, 19:35 - Aswath: 🥲
17/03/2025, 19:36 - Aswath: It's gonna take the rest of my break to get my sleep schedule right
17/03/2025, 19:36 - Aswath: Same here
17/03/2025, 19:37 - Aswath: This was the same as the break last semester
17/03/2025, 19:37 - Aswath: They gave a break and a ton of assignments with it
17/03/2025, 21:31 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: And then school starts and boom back to square one
17/03/2025, 21:32 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I don’t usually have math or physics hw over breaks but there’s ALWAYS an essay to write
17/03/2025, 21:33 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Back in middle school our teachers would literally call this “holiday gift bag”
17/03/2025, 21:36 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Just finished watching portrait of a lady on fire. Beautiful and heart wrenching and I’m actively pouring myself a drink right now
17/03/2025, 22:25 - Aswath: 😂🥲
17/03/2025, 22:25 - Aswath: essay ? what type of essay ?
17/03/2025, 22:26 - Aswath: weird that you have essays when most courses are either physics or maths
17/03/2025, 22:26 - Aswath: the audacity
17/03/2025, 22:27 - Aswath: dude, you've been watching a movie every day. thats nice
17/03/2025, 23:05 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: essays for my philosophy classes. as much as i hate essays i’m already too committed to the philosophy major to pull out 🥲
17/03/2025, 23:07 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: this semester i have two physics and two philosophy. physics and math homeworks usually come once a week so it’s easy for them to just skip a week. but philosophy profs LOVE putting essay deadlines right after a break
17/03/2025, 23:08 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: our homework sheets would literally have “holiday gift bag” printed in the title
17/03/2025, 23:11 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: yeahhhh low key been treating myself more than i should lmao
17/03/2025, 23:12 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i do try to be productive during the day so i can be more guilt free horsing around at night
17/03/2025, 23:15 - Aswath: aah yes, i forgot that you're also a philosophy major
17/03/2025, 23:15 - Aswath: for a subject that is so subjective, the deadlines are very much not
17/03/2025, 23:16 - Aswath: tha faak. i could also tolerate the homeworks but not the attempt to present it as something fun
17/03/2025, 23:16 - Aswath: naah, if you have the time during the break, then you should
17/03/2025, 23:16 - Aswath: aah noice
18/03/2025, 11:07 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Why are you so right tho 💀💀 omw to write an essay criticizing the harmful objectivity of essay deadlines
18/03/2025, 11:08 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Yes it was sickening to see. After a while we got desensitized to those words. The story of middle school hahaha
18/03/2025, 11:12 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Best of luck with your work 🥲 fingers crossed both of us will have a bit more time to enjoy the break after this work blitz
18/03/2025, 14:30 - Aswath: Wait you could do that seriously
18/03/2025, 14:31 - Aswath: I had homework in my middleschool too but they didn't try to disguise it as something fun
18/03/2025, 14:31 - Aswath: The main work that I have is internship search 🥲
18/03/2025, 14:35 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: bro i wish
18/03/2025, 14:37 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: ig they knew it wasn’t fun, and they were intentionally being sarcastic. every ms and hs in china i knew had those holiday gift packs, that’s chinese education for ya
18/03/2025, 14:38 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: huh what a coincidence, i have to look into grad schools
18/03/2025, 14:38 - Aswath: The situation now is Terri
18/03/2025, 14:38 - Aswath: *terrible
18/03/2025, 14:38 - Aswath: With regards to funding and hiring
18/03/2025, 14:39 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: the application that recently ended seemed to have gone pretty well. we’ll see about the next one…
18/03/2025, 14:39 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: post doc applications are definitely already being affected
18/03/2025, 14:40 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: application season for physics grad schools, i mean
18/03/2025, 14:40 - Aswath: I had conversations with phd scholars, they said even phd applications are being affected
18/03/2025, 14:40 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: 😭
18/03/2025, 14:41 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: there will definitely be effects...
18/03/2025, 14:41 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: idk man there’s really nothing we could do
18/03/2025, 14:42 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: hope internships are looking better tho
18/03/2025, 15:43 - Aswath: I hope. Because there's no other way
18/03/2025, 15:43 - Aswath: The effects are already here
18/03/2025, 15:43 - Aswath: 🥲
18/03/2025, 18:53 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i’m actively manifesting rn
18/03/2025, 18:54 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: yup. just earlier today i was informed that the teaching job i’m doing is cutting hours
18/03/2025, 21:06 - Aswath: It's affecting us all
18/03/2025, 21:06 - Aswath: In more ways than we could think of
18/03/2025, 23:50 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: The very first effect I felt, even before the funding cuts, was when the lunar new year celebration at stsci (nasa institute right across the road from bloomberg) got cancelled. Bc it counted as DEI
19/03/2025, 00:40 - Aswath: the what
19/03/2025, 00:40 - Aswath: oh god
19/03/2025, 00:40 - Aswath: this president and his loyalists
19/03/2025, 02:17 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: They’re literally in a competition of who can come up with the stupidest idea like wtf
19/03/2025, 02:23 - Aswath: you think they can't do worse and they prove you wrong
19/03/2025, 13:08 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Right and then there’s half of the country CHEERING for everything they do
19/03/2025, 13:08 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: How tf has it come to this
19/03/2025, 13:33 - Aswath: with his policies, its also gonna affect them
19/03/2025, 13:33 - Aswath: i hope they learn
19/03/2025, 15:40 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: you’d think, but i’ve seen idiots who are affected still defending and justifying his actions. it’s gotta be stockholm syndrome at this point
19/03/2025, 15:42 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: you know how a while ago some alabama residents received a surprise electric bill bc of a new executive order, there were ppl in the comments saying yeah i’d happily pay the bill bc it’s only right
19/03/2025, 16:38 - Aswath: i have no idea of this
19/03/2025, 16:39 - Aswath: but yeah fair point, there have been bad rules who enjoyed continued support
19/03/2025, 16:39 - Aswath: then the only way is for his term to get over
19/03/2025, 17:17 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i think it was a grant for low income family which got frozen by trump 😭
19/03/2025, 17:18 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i literally had no idea THIS many ppl could be so stupid
19/03/2025, 17:21 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: im no expert in american politics but i think there’s hope in turning the senate or house blue in the 2026 midterm elections. that’s at least somethinig
19/03/2025, 17:24 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: also unrelated but i just realized i also had a projector 💀 can’t believe i’ve been watching so many movies on my computer screen
19/03/2025, 17:24 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: so you’re also welcome to watch movies at my place!
19/03/2025, 17:24 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i also have three very cute pet rats
19/03/2025, 17:26 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: <Media omitted>
19/03/2025, 21:34 - Aswath: also the guy's been cutting down the education budget right. its gonna affect the marginal people the most
19/03/2025, 21:36 - Aswath: i have very very little idea of how american politics works
19/03/2025, 21:37 - Aswath: how is it that its something you realize or not on the top of the mind 😶 ?
19/03/2025, 21:37 - Aswath: dude believe me, i want to. but stuck with some work or the other
19/03/2025, 21:38 - Aswath: they're cute but why rats though. unusual choice for a pet
19/03/2025, 22:40 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: everyone knows that education and science are the greatest enemies to this democracy!!! liberals DO NOT want you to know this!!!
19/03/2025, 22:42 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: lmao same, if i know anything about american politics it’s bc it comes right in your face whenever you go on social media these days
19/03/2025, 22:43 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: bc the last time i used it was two years ago. and i just dug it up from one of the boxes from when i was moving
19/03/2025, 22:45 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: it was hard projecting in a dorm bc we had tiny walls at weird angles so we gave up after like one or two uses
19/03/2025, 22:47 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: rats are smart, affectionate, and low maintenance. and domesticated rats are different from wild rats
19/03/2025, 22:48 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: from what short time i’ve had them i do seriously think they’re smarter than my dog back home
19/03/2025, 22:49 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i get it good luck with the work!
19/03/2025, 23:24 - Aswath: i also do not use social media a lot. only use insta to get to know stuff happening at jhu
19/03/2025, 23:25 - Aswath: so did you try it ? how is it at your place now ?
19/03/2025, 23:25 - Aswath: oh you also have a dog. thats nice
19/03/2025, 23:25 - Aswath: hmm, rats are smarter than dogs. interesting
19/03/2025, 23:26 - Aswath: aren't dogs high maintenance ?
19/03/2025, 23:47 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: most of my information and news come from insta, which is not exactly a thing to be proud of
19/03/2025, 23:48 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: didn’t try it yet, was feeling lazy 💀 but i do have a fairly big and empty wall that i can use
19/03/2025, 23:49 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: oh no no i have a dog back home with my parents. i constantly miss her
19/03/2025, 23:50 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: they love solving puzzles
19/03/2025, 23:52 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: very much so. sometimes you’ve had a shit day and just wanna bedrot but the dog needs to be walked
20/03/2025, 00:03 - Aswath: so its not like that i avoid it cause it not that good, i don't like insta
20/03/2025, 00:03 - Aswath: aah nice
20/03/2025, 00:03 - Aswath: interesting, what type ?
20/03/2025, 12:21 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: No that’s respectable. I hate the idea of insta but I’m addicted to it
20/03/2025, 12:23 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: You can hide food in places (wrap it up and put it inside a pouch or smth) and within a day they’ll get it out
20/03/2025, 12:26 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I like putting obstacles in their cage before I go to sleep, usually a piece of cardboard that I stick into somewhere that can’t be easily moved. when I wake up in the morning they will have removed it
21/03/2025, 16:34 - Aswath: My sleep schedule is fucked 😶
21/03/2025, 16:35 - Aswath: I have used insta before but I could notice my mental health degrading over time
21/03/2025, 16:35 - Aswath: The first couple of days its just memes and you just laugh
21/03/2025, 16:35 - Aswath: Then you see the posts which hit your mental health
21/03/2025, 16:36 - Aswath: aah cool
21/03/2025, 16:36 - Aswath: interesting. so how different are the domesticated ones from the wild ones
21/03/2025, 18:02 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: did you just wake up??
21/03/2025, 18:04 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: for me it’s actually not the mental health but just the productivity that insta kills
21/03/2025, 18:05 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: can relate, it’s that cheap dopamine (that personally i just be needing sometimes 😭)
21/03/2025, 18:06 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: what kind of posts? depressing news?
21/03/2025, 18:09 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: a lot like the differences between dogs and wolves. they’re less aggressive, have a lot of pretty coat types, and lack survival skills lmaooo
21/03/2025, 19:52 - Aswath: No I woke up at around 3. Then I was like, I want some fried chicken and I was out of milk
21/03/2025, 19:53 - Aswath: So went to 7-11 for milk and royal farms for chicken. Then had a very good lunch after ages. Then was just lying the couch. There's lot of work but still was just lying.
21/03/2025, 20:00 - Aswath: For me YouTube does that. I have videos playing in one tab and work in an other.
21/03/2025, 20:02 - Aswath: It's like normal other people vacation posts or something. You'll be like I'm in neck deep shit here and these guys are enjoying life.
21/03/2025, 20:03 - Aswath: Rats will have the survival skills irrespective
21/03/2025, 20:56 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: 3 is not much better 💀 how late have you been staying up
21/03/2025, 20:57 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Felt
21/03/2025, 20:58 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I had my YouTube phase and then Reddit phase and now finally rock bottom, insta phase
21/03/2025, 21:00 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Those are all fake bro. I follow a lot of silly meme accounts so I don’t have to see ppl pretending to be celebrities all the time. Most of my feed is pretty depressing and the comments are relatable
21/03/2025, 21:02 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: True they are very clever as prey animals
21/03/2025, 21:42 - Aswath: Yesterday I slept at 2. Did not have any alarms. Woke up for half an hour and then slept again.
21/03/2025, 21:43 - Aswath: Well, it's just a phase. It'll pass.
21/03/2025, 21:45 - Aswath: Yep but the feed is dynamic. As in, it tries to show a lot of content which can trigger you.
21/03/2025, 21:46 - Aswath: What do rats hunt ? I thought they eat trash.
21/03/2025, 23:37 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: That’s crazy cuz I think I went to bed after 2 💀 your sleep debt must’ve been through the roof then
21/03/2025, 23:38 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I’ll get into a new, probably worse, phase… who knows what it’s gonna be
21/03/2025, 23:39 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Then your algorithm isn’t good enough. You gotta keep algorithm engineering
21/03/2025, 23:39 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: No they are the ones being hunted
22/03/2025, 00:10 - Aswath: Could be the debt. But I've been sleeping for the past week. Also that my room is cold. And I have a fuzzy blanket.
22/03/2025, 00:11 - Aswath: It'll get better. It has to.
22/03/2025, 00:11 - Aswath: I don't spend much time. Also at hopkins they don't let you spend much time 🥲.
22/03/2025, 11:44 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: yeah fair, it’s so hard to get out of bed when it’s cold. one reason i like to study outside is that if i study in my room my warm comfy bed will be RIGHT THERE
22/03/2025, 11:46 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: welp, my dad is at retirement age and he’s addicted to tiktok, so…
22/03/2025, 11:47 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: but yeah i’m def not addicted as before. i keep my instagram screen time below 1h30mins
22/03/2025, 11:48 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: felt 💀 it was like that in my freshman and sophomore years, utterly no time to do anything other than work
22/03/2025, 16:47 - Aswath: So I study in the living room. Because I have tried studying in my room and that doesn't work
22/03/2025, 16:47 - Aswath: 90 mins is a reasonable time
22/03/2025, 16:47 - Aswath: It's addicted when you spend like 3-4 hours
22/03/2025, 16:48 - Aswath: Academics is manageable its the job search which isnt
22/03/2025, 22:41 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: we’re in the same boat then 😀 except our living room is basically a storage space rn bc neither of us ever got the time to make it an actual living room
22/03/2025, 22:43 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: high school me was worse but anywayyyy
22/03/2025, 22:44 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: oh damn, how’s that going?
23/03/2025, 00:28 - Aswath: i was in a hostel where we weren't allowed smartphones in high school
23/03/2025, 00:28 - Aswath: i mean, just applying
23/03/2025, 00:28 - Aswath: no callbacks
23/03/2025, 00:29 - Aswath: yep, just sleep there. except that do not spend time there
24/03/2025, 09:30 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: oh rip, we weren’t allowed phones during class but it wasn’t a boarding school so they couldn’t control what we did after school
24/03/2025, 09:31 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: good luck brother, it sounds rough out there
24/03/2025, 09:33 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: that is amazing advice actually, unfortunately our living room is actually unlivable atm. this is why i like to go outside to study
24/03/2025, 20:09 - Aswath: yeah man, its almost a blood bath
24/03/2025, 20:09 - Aswath: the thing is, its so subjective
24/03/2025, 20:10 - Aswath: even the students who got interns or jobs just applied. so the process is the same but not sure of what metric is being used inside the companies
24/03/2025, 20:10 - Aswath: actually, if not for the job hunt, i'd be out all day
25/03/2025, 20:32 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: lose the “almost” and that sounds like what it is…
25/03/2025, 20:32 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i know 😭
25/03/2025, 20:35 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i bet a lot of companies don’t even use metrics, just overall feeling. worse than college application where they’re at least supposed to use metrics
25/03/2025, 20:36 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i felt that 😭 do you know how your cohort is doing? everyone going through it?
25/03/2025, 21:08 - Aswath: yeah, college applications are an another night mare
25/03/2025, 21:08 - Aswath: don't know what criteria they use to decide
25/03/2025, 21:09 - Aswath: a few did get internships but everyone's busy so i don't think everyone is updated with the information
25/03/2025, 22:22 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: some schools do disclose that, they score applicants on academics, athletics, etc. but i did request to see my application package from the hopkins admissions office, and the comment on my essays & stuff was very minimal. i just can’t believe i spent days and nights working on those applications just for admissions officers to summarize them in 2 sentences
25/03/2025, 22:33 - Aswath: yeah, its highly subjective
19/04/2025, 18:21 - Aswath: <Media omitted>
19/04/2025, 18:21 - Aswath: dude how have you been
19/04/2025, 18:21 - Aswath: the weather is getting really good in the city
19/04/2025, 20:49 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: not bad, thanks for checking in! things are definitely getting busier with the semester coming to an end, but somehow i’m staying afloat. how have you been?!
19/04/2025, 20:50 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: was celebrating a friend’s paper submission last night, partied a bit too hard and ended up sleeping for almost the entire day today 💀 so tonight and tomorrow i gotta grind fr
19/04/2025, 20:52 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: this is too real, i can’t tap into my full potential unless there’s a deadline staring at me in the face. and then the project that has seemed impossible for the entire month, miraculously gets done in a single all-nighter
19/04/2025, 20:54 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: yeah! the campus is beautiful rn
19/04/2025, 21:55 - Aswath: dude you don't need to say thanks.
19/04/2025, 21:55 - Aswath: the sem's almost coming to an end and surprisingly the workload for 2-3 days has been quite light.
19/04/2025, 21:56 - Aswath: oh nice. have deadlines coming up or the exams ?
19/04/2025, 21:57 - Aswath: yep, so there's this law called the parkinson's law. it goes like this "work expands to the time allotted"
19/04/2025, 21:57 - Aswath: yeah, with the amount of green after so many months, its pretty good
21/04/2025, 08:49 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: that’s amazing tho! like the semester is actually winding down instead of cranking up (my sem is very much doing the latter 🤡)
21/04/2025, 08:53 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: cleared 1 of 2 deadlines last night, so i gotta clear that other one today 😭 the prof doesn’t mind me submitting overdue but i’ve kinda been pushing the limit…
21/04/2025, 08:54 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: wait really! i’m so glad that this is a properly recognized phenomenon, bc it’s literally the story of my life
21/04/2025, 08:56 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: ik, winter was finally over thank god
21/04/2025, 18:14 - Aswath: no no dude, it's was just specific to the 2 days. I just got one of my final presentations done.
21/04/2025, 18:15 - Aswath: physics or philosophy ?
21/04/2025, 18:15 - Aswath: yeah, i kinda reacted the same when i first heard of it
21/04/2025, 18:55 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Yo that’s huge, congrats! Do you have any finals?
21/04/2025, 18:56 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Physics yesterday, philosophy today. But the philosophy is philosophy of physics, so I feel like I’ve been doing physics for ages
21/04/2025, 18:56 - Aswath: yeah dude, 2 finals and 2 more projects
21/04/2025, 18:56 - Aswath: the peace was temporary
21/04/2025, 18:57 - Aswath: like the christmas break solders take in wars
21/04/2025, 18:57 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Same, 2 finals and 2 papers
21/04/2025, 18:57 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: One of the finals is literally in the last possible timeslot
21/04/2025, 18:57 - Aswath: <Media omitted>
21/04/2025, 18:59 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: You know the meme that’s like, on new years eve,
11:59 work
0:00 little confettis 
0:01 work
21/04/2025, 18:59 - Aswath: if you're wondering this is from the inception
21/04/2025, 18:59 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Me after these homeworks
21/04/2025, 19:00 - Aswath: we've almost crossed it
21/04/2025, 19:00 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Oh I’ve seen inception! So good
21/04/2025, 19:00 - Aswath: big fan of nolan
21/04/2025, 19:00 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: The last bit is always the hardest
21/04/2025, 19:00 - Aswath: that's what she said
21/04/2025, 19:01 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I love the prestige
21/04/2025, 19:01 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Goddammit
21/04/2025, 19:01 - Aswath: from the office
21/04/2025, 19:02 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: But you always leave me satisfied and smiling
21/04/2025, 19:05 - Aswath: aah a man of culture
21/04/2025, 19:06 - Aswath: 😂❤️
21/04/2025, 20:48 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Man I need to finish the office
21/04/2025, 20:48 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I actually never got around to watching the last few seasons
21/04/2025, 21:08 - Aswath: so when did you stop watching ?
22/04/2025, 09:22 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I can’t tell you exactly, the last time I watched it I was in high school
22/04/2025, 09:22 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I definitely saw Michael leave the office that’s for sure
22/04/2025, 09:25 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I was always more fond of the Dwight-Angela storyline than the Jim-Pam one lmaoooo idk about you
22/04/2025, 10:39 - Aswath: around 3 years back. same time frame here.
22/04/2025, 12:50 - Aswath: oh nice. the office for me ended right there with Michael leaving.
22/04/2025, 12:51 - Aswath: after michael left, i just saw the last episode of him coming back
22/04/2025, 14:14 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i do hear that the show kinda fell off after michael left 😭 but i wanna see it for myself
22/04/2025, 14:14 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: ok there has t be SOME good stuff in between. i’ll watch and tell you
22/04/2025, 16:18 - Aswath: there would be good stuff, but for me it's not office if michael isn't there
22/04/2025, 16:18 - Aswath: i did try some episodes but couldn't
22/04/2025, 18:08 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I do get that. I’ve seen clips of those later seasons, they do feel different
22/04/2025, 18:10 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Ig it’s really hard for a show to be streaming for so long and still remain good
22/04/2025, 18:33 - Aswath: <Media omitted>
22/04/2025, 18:33 - Aswath: nolan's a genius
23/04/2025, 09:15 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Omg this
23/04/2025, 09:15 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: There is ALWAYS an appropriate quote
23/04/2025, 09:16 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Times change. Neither heroes nor villains are forever
23/04/2025, 09:16 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Anyway ig by your standards I have finished the office then!
23/04/2025, 09:17 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: (Again you have to check out parks and recreation if you’re a fan of the office)
23/04/2025, 14:03 - Aswath: you mean this one or in general
23/04/2025, 14:04 - Aswath: i actually like quotes. i read them sometimes when i'm free
23/04/2025, 14:05 - Aswath: i might not touch series for some time though. will have to watch quite some movies after this semester
23/04/2025, 18:46 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: In general lmaooo. Another related thing is, no matter what situation you find yourself in, there’s ALWAYS a meme that describes your exact feelings
23/04/2025, 18:47 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I find quotes a bit too idealistic, and most of them only apply in very restricted situations
23/04/2025, 18:48 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Very fair! I need to make progress on both
23/04/2025, 22:50 - Aswath: they also say this for with movies. there's a movie for every problem.
23/04/2025, 22:50 - Aswath: some quotes are really nice. yeah, it is restricted but some are really good.
23/04/2025, 22:50 - Aswath: what's your plan for summer ?
23/04/2025, 22:50 - Aswath: baltimore or you traveling?
24/04/2025, 01:59 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Interesting. Tho a lot of movies GIVE me problems I never thought I’d have
24/04/2025, 01:59 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: What are some of your favorites?
24/04/2025, 02:02 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: There’s actually this Buddhist saying that I really like: first you see mountains as mountains, then you see that mountains are not mountains, and finally you see once again that mountains are mountains
24/04/2025, 02:03 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Equivalent meme: the three-stage bell curve meme lollll
24/04/2025, 02:04 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I’m staying here the whole summer, prolly gonna do short trips within the country
24/04/2025, 02:04 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: How about you?
24/04/2025, 02:14 - Aswath: such as
24/04/2025, 02:14 - Aswath: i mean, all of a sudden. there's a lot
24/04/2025, 02:16 - Aswath: from the top of my head this is one that i use from time to time - 
“Explaining humor is a lot like dissecting a frog, you learn a lot in the process, but in the end you kill it.” - Mark Twain
24/04/2025, 02:16 - Aswath: would be here except for month where I'll go to india
25/04/2025, 10:15 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: synecdoche new york 💀 yes my favorite movie is one that fucked me up fr
25/04/2025, 10:15 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: the feeling is so complex i dont think i’d get it from anywhere else
25/04/2025, 10:17 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: yeah that’s a good one. what i love about humor or any human construct is that it evolves. explaining a joke can itself become a meta-joke, if you do it smart. you can revive the frog, unlike in biology
25/04/2025, 10:18 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: nice enjoy your time home!!
25/04/2025, 16:41 - Aswath: kauffman, have to see that one
25/04/2025, 16:41 - Aswath: that would need a really good comedian
25/04/2025, 16:41 - Aswath: we'll hangout before I leave
25/04/2025, 19:32 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Are you a Kaufman fan? Which movie is your favorite?
25/04/2025, 19:34 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: That’s true. Although perhaps if they were a good comedian, their joke would just land without them having to explain it
25/04/2025, 19:36 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Yes let’s!! I have two finals and they’re both on the last day of finals may 12th 💀 but after that I should be all free
25/04/2025, 20:44 - Aswath: no no i know that he's a big deal, but haven't watched his movies yet
25/04/2025, 20:47 - Aswath: yep, i think that if the audience do not understand your jokes, they'll not like it so much
25/04/2025, 20:47 - Aswath: cool we're definitely hanging out. let's try to explore the city.
26/04/2025, 00:13 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: I’ve heard that he’s a master of feel bad movies 💀 which are unfortunately right up my alley
26/04/2025, 00:15 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Have you been to a standup comedy show here in baltimore?
26/04/2025, 00:15 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: We have to bro let’s gooo
26/04/2025, 01:50 - Aswath: feel bad, there's a genre for that. that's what life's for
26/04/2025, 01:51 - Aswath: nope, i think there's a comedy club in inner harbor right ?
26/04/2025, 09:34 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Truly life is the ultimate feel bad movie
26/04/2025, 09:35 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Oh probably, I just know that they do quite a lot of stand up comedy shows in ottobar
26/04/2025, 16:38 - Aswath: is it ? we must give it a shot.
26/04/2025, 16:38 - Aswath: I do wanna see the comedy culture of baltimore
26/04/2025, 17:24 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Yes ottobar seems really cool and I can’t believe I’ve still never been there! They should have an event calendar somewhere
26/04/2025, 17:33 - Aswath: yep, dude you've been underage
26/04/2025, 17:33 - Aswath: they wouldn't allow you unless you're 21 right ?
26/04/2025, 19:50 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: man 💀 touche
26/04/2025, 19:50 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: they have all age shows
26/04/2025, 19:51 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: but yeah a lot are 21+
26/04/2025, 20:05 - Aswath: but are you now 21 or above ?
26/04/2025, 20:58 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i will be in august 😭
27/04/2025, 00:57 - Aswath: when in august ?
27/04/2025, 08:56 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: August 27th
27/04/2025, 08:57 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: Yes regrettably I will be underage for basically the whole summer
27/04/2025, 12:43 - Aswath: no problem, we'll find events where there is no age restriction
27/04/2025, 20:19 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: there should be plenty!
27/04/2025, 20:19 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: i have an asian friend who used to be able to lend me his ID but he’s graduating 🥲
27/04/2025, 20:39 - Aswath: dude even i don't drink much
27/04/2025, 20:39 - Aswath: there's a lot of options for fun even without alcohol involved
27/04/2025, 21:40 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: that’s true
27/04/2025, 21:40 - Ryan UGPhysics Johns Hopkins: a lot of fun does happen when alcohol is involved. but yeah if you need alcohol to have fun then you need to rethink your life
