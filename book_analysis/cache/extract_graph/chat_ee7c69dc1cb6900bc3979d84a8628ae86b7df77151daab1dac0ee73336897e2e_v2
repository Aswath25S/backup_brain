If he thought their proposal was high, he would counter with his best price, and if the seller rejected his offer, Murphy would walk away. He believed this straightforward approach saved time and avoided unnecessary acrimony.\n\nShare repurchases were another important outlet for Murphy, providing him with an important capital allocation benchmark, and he made frequent use of them over the years. When the company’s multiple was low relative to private market comparables, Murphy bought back stock. Over the years, Murphy devoted over $1.8 billion to buybacks, mostly at single-digit multiples of cash flow. Collectively, these repurchases represented a very large bet for the company, second in size only to the ABC transaction, and they generated excellent returns for shareholders, with a cumulative compound return of 22.4 percent over nineteen years. As Murphy says today, “I only wished I’d bought more.”\n\nThe Publishing Division\n\nAfter the Triangle transaction in 1970, Capital Cities was prevented from owning additional TV stations by FCC regulations. As a result, Murphy turned his attention to newspapers and, between 1974 and 1978, initiated the two largest transactions in the industry’s history to that time—the acquisition of the Fort Worth Telegram and the Kansas City Star—as well as the purchase of several smaller daily and weekly newspapers across the United States.\n\nThe company’s performance in its newspaper publishing division provides an interesting litmus test of its operating skills. Under the leadership of Jim Hale and Phil Meek, Capital Cities evolved an approach to the newspaper business that grew out of its experience in operating TV stations, with an emphasis on careful cost control and maximizing advertising market share.\n\nWhat is remarkable in looking at the company’s four major newspaper operations is the consistent year-after-year-after-year growth in revenues and operating cash flow. Amazingly, these properties, which were sold to Knight Ridder in 1997, collectively produced a 25 percent compound rate of return over an average twenty-year holding period. According to the Kansas City Star’s publisher Bob Woodworth (subsequently the CEO of Pulitzer Inc.), the operating margin at the Star, the company’s largest paper, expanded from the single digits in the mid-1970s to a high of 35 percent in 1996, while cash flow grew from $12.5 million to $68 million.\n\nThe phenomenal long-term performance of Capital Cities drew the admiration of the country’s top media investors. Warren Buffett and Mario Gabelli each went back to the legendary Yankee sluggers of their respective eras (Ruth and Gehrig for Buffett, and Mantle and Maris for Gabelli) to find analogies for Murphy and Burke’s managerial performance. Gordon Crawford, a shareholder from 1972 until the Disney sale and one of the most influential media investors in the country, believed Murphy and Burke’s unique blend of operating and capital allocation skills created a “perpetual motion machine for returns.”12 Capital Cities’ admirers also included Bill Ruane of Ruane, Cunniff, and David Wargo of State Street Research.\n\nChronicle Publishing: A Successful Transplant\n\nCapital Cities’ distinctive approach to operations and human resources was successfully transplanted to a West Coast media company, Chronicle Publishing, in the mid- to late 1990s by John Sias, the former head of Capital Cities’ publishing division and the ABC Network. In 1993, Sias took over as the CEO of Chronicle, a diversified, family-owned media company, headquartered in San Francisco.\n\nChronicle owned the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper, the NBC affiliate in San Francisco (KRON), three hundred thousand cable subscribers, and a book publishing company. Prior to Sias’s arrival, the company had been torn by family squabbling, and operations had suffered. Sias and his young CFO, Alan Nichols, wasted no time in implementing the Capital Cities operating model, radically transforming the company’s operations. They immediately eliminated an entire layer of executives at corporate headquarters, instituted a rigorous budgeting process, and gave significant authority and autonomy to the general managers (many of whom, uncomfortable in the new, more demanding culture, left in the first year).\n\nThe results were stunning. The margins at KRON improved by an incredible 2,000 basis points, from 30 percent to 50 percent (KRON was eventually sold for over $730 million in June 2000), and the operating margins at the Chronicle newspaper (which operated under an unusual joint operating agreement with the San Francisco Examiner) more than doubled, from 4 percent to 10 percent (Hearst bought the paper for an astronomical $660 million in 1999). Sias and Nichols also merged the cable subscribers into Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) in a tax-free exchange and sold the book division at an attractive price to one of the family members. Sias retired from the company in 1999, after having created hundreds of millions of dollars of value for its shareholders.\n\nThe Diaspora\n\nAs with the large number of successful NFL coaches who once worked for Bill Walsh or surgeons who worked at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston in the 1950s and 1960s under Francis Moore, the media world is littered with Capital Cities alums. The company’s culture and operating model were widely admired, and in addition to Sias at Chronicle, former company executives have occupied top management slots at a dizzying variety of media companies, starting with Disney itself (now run by Bob Iger). Capital Cities alums have also held executive positions at LIN Broadcasting (CEO), Pulitzer (CEO), Hearst (CFO), and E. W. Scripps (head of newspaper operations), among others.
