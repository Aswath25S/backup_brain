When he received an inquiry from AT&T’s aggressive new CEO, Mike Armstrong, he eagerly initiated discussions. Characteristically, he handled the negotiations himself, often facing a sizable crowd of AT&T lawyers, bankers, and accountants across the table.\n\nAs talks between the two companies unfolded, Malone proved to be as adept at selling as he had been at acquiring. As Rick Reiss said, “He turned the board of AT&T upside down, shook every nickel from their pockets, and returned them to their board seats.”7 The financial terms—twelve times EBITDA, $2,600 per subscriber—were extraordinary and, remarkably, the company received no discount for its patchwork quilt of decrepit rural systems. Not surprisingly, Malone, ever watchful of unnecessary taxes, structured the transaction as a stock deal, allowing his investors to defer capital gains taxes.\n\nIn addition, Malone retained effective control of the Liberty programming subsidiary with six of nine board seats and secured an attractive, long-term carriage deal for Liberty’s channels on AT&T’s cable systems. This transaction was the final resounding validation of Malone’s unique strategy at TCI: producing exceptional returns for his investors. Mind-boggling returns, in fact: in the twenty-five years after Malone took the helm at TCI, the entire cable industry grew enormously, and all the public companies in it prospered. No cable executive, however, created remotely as much value for shareholders as Malone. From his debut in 1973 until 1998 when the company was sold to AT&T, the compound return to TCI’s shareholders was a phenomenal 30.3 percent, compared with 20.4 percent for other publicly traded cable companies and 14.3 percent for the S&P 500 over the same period (see figure 4-1).\n\nA dollar invested with TCI at the beginning of the Malone era was worth over $900 by mid-1998. That same dollar was worth $180 if invested in the other publicly traded cable companies and $22 if invested in the S&P 500. Thus TCI outperformed the S&P by over fortyfold and its public peers by fivefold during Malone’s tenure.\n\nFIGURE 4-1\n\nTotal return to shareholders dramatically exceeded the S&P 500 and competitors’ returns during Malone’s tenure\n\n\n\nSource: Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and TCI annual reports.\n\na.

Comps include Adelphia Communications, American Television & Communications, Cablevision Systems, Century Communications, Comcast, Cox Communications, Cox Cable, Falcon Cable Systems, Heritage Communications, Jones Intercable, Storer Broadcasting, TelePrompTer, and United Cable Television.\n\nThe Nuts and Bolts\n\nThe cable television business during Malone’s tenure was extremely capital intensive, with enormous amounts of cash required to build, buy, and maintain cable systems. As Malone sought to achieve scale by growing his subscriber base, three primary sources of capital were available to him in addition to TCI’s robust operating cash flow: debt, equity, and asset sales. His use of each of these sources was distinctive.\n\nMalone pioneered the active use of debt in the cable industry. He believed financial leverage had two important attributes: it magnified financial returns, and it helped shelter TCI’s cash flow from taxes through the deductibility of interest payments. Malone targeted a ratio of five times debt to EBITDA and maintained it throughout most of the 1980s and 1990s. Scale allowed TCI to minimize its cost of debt, and Malone, having survived the harrowing experience of the mid-1970s, structured his debt with great care to lower costs and avoid cross-collateralization so that if one system defaulted on its debt, it would not affect the credit of the entire company. This compartmentalization into “bulkheads” (the term derived from Malone’s fascination with all things nautical—he also sometimes referred to TCI’s “bow wave of depreciation”) caused further complexity in TCI’s structure, but provided the company with substantial downside protection.\n\nWhen it came to issuing equity, Malone was parsimonious, with the company’s occasional offerings timed to coincide with record high multiples on his stock. As Malone said in a 1980 interview, “Our recent rise in stock price provided us with a good opportunity for this offering.”8 He was justifiably proud of his stinginess in issuing equity and believed it was another factor that distinguished him from his peers.\n\nMalone occasionally and opportunistically sold assets. He coolly evaluated the public and private values for cable systems and traded actively in both markets when he saw discrepancies. Malone carefully managed the company’s supply of net operating losses (NOLs), accumulated over years of depreciation and interest deductions, which allowed him to sell assets without paying taxes. As a result of this tax shield, he was comfortable selling systems if prices were attractive, to raise capital to fund future growth. As Malone told David Wargo as early as 1981, “It makes sense to maybe sell off some of our systems . . . at 10 times cash flow to buy back our stock at 7 times.”9\n\nAnother key source of capital at the company was taxes not paid. As we’ve seen, tax minimization was a central component of Malone’s strategy at TCI, and he took Magness’s historical approach to taxes to an entirely new level. Malone abhorred taxes; they offended his libertarian sensibilities, and he applied his engineering mind-set to the problem of minimizing the “leakage” from taxes as he might have minimized signal leakage on an electrical engineering exam. As the company grew its cash flow by twentyfold over Malone’s tenure, it never paid significant taxes.\n\nIn fact,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
