At a time when virtually all of corporate America was sitting on the sidelines, shepherding cash, and nursing ailing balance sheets, these two lions in winter were actively on the prowl.\n\nBuffett, after a long period of relative inactivity stretching back to the immediate aftermath of 9/11, has had one of the most active periods of his long career. Since the fourth quarter of 2008, he has deployed over $80 billion (over $15 billion of it in the first twenty-five days after the Lehman collapse) in a wide variety of investing activities:\n\n• Purchased $8 billion of convertible preferred stock from\n\nGoldman Sachs and General Electric\n\n• Made a number of common stock purchases (including Constellation Energy): $9 billion\n\n• Provided mezzanine financing to Mars/Wrigley ($6.5 billion) and Dow Chemical ($3 billion)\n\n• Bought various distressed debt securities in the open market: $8.9 billion\n\n• In Berkshire’s largest deal ever by dollar value, bought the 77.5 percent of Burlington Northern that he didn’t already own for $26.5 billion\n\n• Acquired Lubrizol, a leading, publicly traded lubricant company for $8.7 billion\n\n• Announced a sizable ($10.9 billion) new investment in IBM stock\n\nOver the same period, John Malone has been quietly conducting an extended experiment in aggressive capital allocation across the disparate entities that were spun out of TCI’s original programming arm, Liberty Media. In the depths of the financial crisis, Malone:\n\n• Implemented a “leveraged equity growth” strategy at satellite programming giant DIRECTV—increasing debt and aggressively repurchasing stock (over 40 percent of shares outstanding in the last twenty-four months).\n\n• Initiated a series of moves across the former Liberty entities, including the spin-off of cable programmer Starz/Encore and a debt-for-equity swap between Liberty Capital (owner of Malone’s polyglot collection of public and private assets) and Liberty Interactive (home of the QVC shopping network and other online entities).\n\n• Swept in and bought control of Sirius Broadcasting, the satellite radio service, through Liberty Capital, in a distressed (and extremely attractive) transaction at the nadir of the market in early 2009. He also bought back 11 percent of Liberty Capital’s shares in the second quarter of 2010.\n\n• Through his international cable arm, Liberty Global, announced the company’s largest acquisition ever, the purchase of German cable company Unitymedia for over €5 billion (less than seven times cash flow), as well as the sale of its sizable stake in Japan’s largest cable business for over nine times cash flow (with all proceeds sheltered from taxes by the company’s enormous pool of net operating losses). He also continued Liberty Global’s aggressive buyback program (the company has repurchased over half its shares in the last five years).\n\nPhew . . . so while corporate America generally stood frozen on the sidelines, these two wily CEOs engaged in an orgy of Keynesian “animal spirits.” They were, to qualify Buffett’s dictum, very greedy at a time when their peers trembled with unprecedented fear.\n\n\n\n\n\nEpilogue\n\nAn Example and a Checklist\n\n\nLet’s conclude with an example that shows the outsider approach at work in a different setting.\n\nSuppose you own a successful high-end bakery, specializing in baguettes and fresh pastries. The key to your success is a special oven manufactured in Italy, and you have the high-class problem of more demand than you can keep up with.\n\nYou are faced with two choices for growing the business: expand into the space next door and buy a second oven, or open a new store, in a different part of town, which also requires a new oven. A competitor of yours in a different part of the city has recently expanded its store with great success, and you’ve recently read about a publicly traded baking company that has grown through carefully enlarging existing stores. Conventional wisdom points to expanding your store as the right path, but you sit down and do the math.\n\nYou start by calculating the up-front cost and likely revenues and profits for each scenario, using what you believe to be conservative assumptions. You then calculate the return for each, starting with the expansion option.\n\nYou’ve decided your personal hurdle rate: you will go forward only if the project can produce at least a 20 percent return. You make the following calculations: a new oven costs $50,000; additional space in your existing building costs $50,000 to build out and would likely produce incremental annual profits of $20,000 after labor, material, and other operating costs. So, you have $100,000 in up-front costs (the oven plus the build-out) and an expected annual profit of $20,000, for an expected return of 20 percent—right at your hurdle rate.\n\nYou then turn your attention to the new-store option. The upfront costs include an oven at a cost of $50,000 and $150,000 in build-out expenses. The scenarios for the new store are harder to predict (it’s in a different part of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WARREN
