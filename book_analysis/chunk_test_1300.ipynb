Rather, they labored in relative obscurity and were generally appreciated by only a handful of sophisticated investors and aficionados . As a group, they shared old-fashioned, premodern values including frugality, humility, independence, and an unusual combination of conservatism and boldness . They typically worked out of bare-bones offices (of which they were inordinately proud), generally eschewed perks such as corporate planes, avoided the spotlight wherever possible, and rarely communicated with Wall Street or the business press . They also actively avoided bankers and other advisers, preferring their own counsel and that of a select group around them . Ben Franklin would have liked these guys. This group of happily married, middle-aged men (and one woman) led seemingly unexciting, balanced, quietly philanthropic lives, yet in their business lives they were neither conventional nor complacent . They were positive deviants, and they were deeply iconoclastic. The word iconoclast is derived from Greek and means “smasher of icons .” The word has evolved to have the more general meaning of someone who is determinedly different, proudly eccentric . The original iconoclasts came from outside the societies (and temples) where icons resided; they were challengers of societal norms and conventions, and they were much feared in ancient Greece .

In the middle of this dark period, in August 1979, BusinessWeek famously ran a cover story titled “Are Equities Dead?” The times, like now, were so uncertain and scary that most managers sat on their hands, but for all the outsider CEOs it was among the most active periods of their careers—every single one was engaged in either a significant share repurchase program or a series of large acquisitions (or in the case of Tom Murphy, both) . As a group, they were, in the words of Warren Buffett, very “greedy” while their peers were deeply “fearful.”a a. Author interview with Warren Buffett, July 24, 2006. This reformulation of the CEO’s job stemmed from shared (and unusual) backgrounds. All of these CEOs were outsiders .

They were not bound by prior experience or industry convention, and their collective records show the enormous power of fresh eyes\n",

      "7. **Innovative Thinking**: Despite not having extensive managerial experience before becoming CEOs, they brought fresh perspectives and innovative approaches to their roles, which contributed to their exceptional performance.\n",

      "The best CEOs, as highlighted in the context, are those who adopt an unorthodox approach to management, focusing on long-term value creation rather than short-term growth. These CEOs, often referred to as \"outsider CEOs,\" include figures like Warren Buffett, Henry Singleton, and Rex Tillerson. Their success is attributed to several key principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Long-term Value Focus**: These CEOs prioritize optimizing long-term value per share over mere organizational growth. They understand that bigger isn't always better and often shrink their operations through asset sales or spin-offs to maximize shareholder value.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Capital Allocation**: They are adept at capital allocation, directing resources toward high-return projects and avoiding value-destroying investments. This involves a disciplined approach to financial management, often requiring a minimum return on capital projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Decentralization**: They run highly decentralized organizations, empowering local managers and reducing the need for a large corporate staff. This approach acknowledges that value is often created at the local level rather than at headquarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Share Repurchases**: These CEOs frequently engage in share repurchases, not to prop up stock prices but because they see it as a valuable investment in itself. This strategy helps manage the denominator in value per share calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Pragmatic and Analytical**: They apply a rational, analytical approach to decision-making, focusing on cash flow rather than reported net income. This mindset allows them to cut through conventional wisdom and peer pressure, making decisions based on core economic realities.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Flexibility and Patience**: They exhibit a patient, pragmatic opportunism, adapting their strategies to the circumstances rather than following rigid plans. This flexibility allows them to capitalize on opportunities as they arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Investor Mindset**: These CEOs think more like investors than traditional managers, acting boldly when they see discrepancies between value and price. They are comfortable waiting for the right opportunities, sometimes for extended periods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the best CEOs are those who combine a disciplined, analytical approach with a willingness to think independently and act decisively, ultimately creating significant value for shareholders over the long term.\n"
