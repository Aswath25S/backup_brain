The Continental Baking acquisition was sourced from a letter he sent directly to ITT chairman Rand Araskog, thus circumventing an auction.\n\nStiritz believed that Ralston should only pursue opportunities that presented compelling returns under conservative assumptions, and he disdained the false precision of detailed financial models, focusing instead on a handful of key variables: market growth, competition, potential operating improvements, and, always, cash generation. As he told me, “I really only cared about the key assumptions going into the model. First, I wanted to know about the underlying trends in the market: its growth and competitive dynamics.”4\n\nHis protégé, Pat Mulcahy, who would later run the business, described Stiritz’s approach to the seminal Energizer acquisition: “When the opportunity to buy Energizer came up, a small group of us met at 1:00 PM and got the seller’s books. We performed a back of the envelope LBO model, met again at 4:00 PM and decided to bid $1.4 billion. Simple as that. We knew what we needed to focus on. No massive studies and no bankers.”5 Again, Stiritz’s approach (similar to those of Tom Murphy, John Malone, Katharine Graham, and others) featured a single sheet of paper and an intense focus on key assumptions, not a forty-page set of projections.\n\n. . .\n\nStiritz, aware of the early LBOs in the packaged goods industry, consciously adopted a private equity–like mind-set. His managerial worldview was neatly summarized by Mulcahy: “Stiritz ran Ralston somewhat akin to an LBO. He was one of the first to see the benefit to shareholders of higher leverage as long as cash flows were strong and predictable . . . He simply got rid of businesses that were cash drains (no matter their provenance) . . . and invested more deeply in existing strong businesses through massive share purchases interspersed with the occasional acquisition that met our return targets.”6\n\nStiritz married nuts-and-bolts packaged goods marketing expertise with financial acumen, an unusual combination. He focused on newfangled metrics, like EBITDA and internal rate of return (IRR), that were becoming the lingua franca of the nascent private equity industry, and he eschewed more traditional accounting measures, such as reported earnings and book value, that were Wall Street’s preferred financial metrics at the time. He had particular disdain for book value, once declaring during a rare appearance at an industry conference that “book equity has no meaning in our business,” a statement that was greeted with stunned silence by the audience, according to longtime analyst John Bierbusse. Mauboussin added, “You have to have fortitude to look past book value, EPS, and other standard accounting metrics which don’t always correlate with economic reality.”7\n\n. . .\n\nStiritz was fiercely independent, and actively disdained the advice of outside advisers. He believed that charisma was overrated as a managerial attribute and that analytical skill was a critical prerequisite for a CEO and the key to independent thinking: “Without it, chief executives are at the mercy of their bankers and CFOs.” Stiritz observed that many CEOs came from functional areas (legal, marketing, manufacturing, sales) where this sort of analytical ability was not required. Without it, he believed they were severely handicapped. His counsel was simple: “Leadership is analysis.”\n\nThis independent mind-set translated into an innate suspicion bordering on distrust of outside advisers, particularly investment bankers, whom Stiritz once described as “parasitic.” He was surgical in his use of advisers—using as few as possible, always in a carefully targeted manner—and he was aggressive in negotiating their fees, holding up the multibillion-dollar Nestlé deal when he felt the bankers were overcharging him. He made a point of using different bankers for various transactions so that none felt overly secure about his business.\n\nHe was well known for showing up alone to important due diligence meetings or negotiations where the other side of the table was crowded with bankers and lawyers. Stiritz relished this unorthodox approach. A then junior banker at Goldman Sachs told me of a late-night due diligence session during the RJR Nabisco sale process when Stiritz came to a conference room at the Goldman offices alone, armed only with a yellow legal pad, and proceeded to walk through the key operating assumptions one by one before making a final bid and going to bed. He actively enjoyed the investment process and, after selling Ralston, vigorously managed an investment partnership consisting primarily of his own capital.\n\n. . .\n\nStiritz jealously guarded his time, eschewing high-visibility, time-consuming philanthropic boards, and avoiding casual lunches as “mostly a waste of time.” As he explained, “It got to the point where they were taking up too much time, so I stopped them completely.” He did, however, make time to sit on other corporate boards, viewing this as a unique opportunity to expose himself to new situations and ideas.\n\nHe was always a fox-like sponge for new thinking regardless of its origin. John McMillin, a longtime industry analyst, once wrote, “Some people are innovators and some people borrow ideas from others. Stiritz is both (and that’s meant as a compliment).”8 He consciously carved out blocks of time in his schedule to wrestle with the key issues in the business alone, without distraction, whether on a Florida beach or in his home office in St. Louis.\n\nHe avoided time-consuming interactions with Wall Street and retained, in the words of analyst John Bierbusse, “a certain Garbo-like quality,” rarely speaking to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STIRITZ<|>PERSON<|>Stiritz is a business executive known for his independent and analytical approach to management, focusing on key financial metrics and avoiding traditional accounting measures.
