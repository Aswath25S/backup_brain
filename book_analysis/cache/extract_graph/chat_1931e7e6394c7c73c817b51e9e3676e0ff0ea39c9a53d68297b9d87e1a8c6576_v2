A proxy for these returns can be seen in figure 2-1, which shows the approximately eightfold growth in book value at Teledyne’s insurance subsidiaries from 1975 through 1985, when Singleton began the process of dismantling his company.\n\nDuring the period from 1984 to 1996, Singleton shifted his focus from portfolio management to management succession (in 1986, he tapped Roberts to succeed him as CEO, retaining the chairman’s title) and to optimizing shareholder value in the face of stagnating results at Teledyne’s operating divisions. To accomplish these objectives, Singleton resorted to new tactics, again confounding Wall Street.\n\nFIGURE 2-1\n\nTeledyne insurance book value ($ in millions)a\n\n\n\na. Shows sum of book equity values for Unitrin and Argonaut subsidiaries.\n\nSingleton was a pioneer in the use of spin-offs, which he believed would both simplify succession issues at Teledyne (by reducing the company’s complexity) and unlock the full value of the company’s large insurance operations for shareholders. In the words of longtime board member Fayez Sarofim, Singleton believed “there was a time to conglomerate and a time to deconglomerate.”7 The time for deconglomeration finally arrived in 1986 with the debut spin-off of Argonaut, the company’s worker’s compensation insurer.\n\nNext, in 1990, Singleton spun off Unitrin, the company’s largest insurance operation, with Jerry Jerome as CEO. This was a significant move as Unitrin accounted for the majority of Teledyne’s enterprise value at that time. It has had excellent returns since going public under the leadership of Jerome and his successor, Dick Vie.\n\nStarting in the mid- to late 1980s, Teledyne’s noninsurance operations slowed in the face of a cyclical downturn in the energy and specialty metals markets and fraud charges at its defense business. In 1987, at a time when both acquisition and stock prices (including his own) were at historic highs, Singleton concluded that he had no better, higher-returning options for deploying the company’s cash flow, and declared the company’s first dividend in twenty-six years as a public company. This was a seismic event for longtime Teledyne observers, signaling the arrival of a new phase in the company’s history.\n\nAfter these successful spin-offs and with Roberts established in the CEO role, Singleton retired as chairman in 1991 to focus on his extensive cattle ranching operations. (Ranching held a singular appeal for Singleton as it did for many successful, Texas-born entrepreneurs of his generation, and he would eventually acquire over 1 million acres of ranchland across New Mexico, Arizona, and California.) He returned, however, in 1996 to personally negotiate the merger of Teledyne’s remaining manufacturing operations with Allegheny Industries and fend off a hostile takeover bid by raider Bennett LeBow. In these negotiations, according to Bill Rutledge, Teledyne’s president at the time, Singleton focused exclusively on getting the best possible price, ignoring other peripheral issues such as management titles and board composition.8 Again, the outcome was a favorable one for Teledyne share holders: a 30 percent premium to the company’s prior trading price.\n\nSingleton left behind an extraordinary record, dwarfing both his peers and the market. From 1963 (the first year for which we have reliable stock data) to 1990, when he stepped down as chairman, Singleton delivered a remarkable 20.4 percent compound annual return to his shareholders (including spin-offs), compared to an 8.0 percent return for the S&P 500 over the same period and an 11.6 percent return for other major conglomerate stocks (see figure 2-2).\n\nA dollar invested with Henry Singleton in 1963 would have been worth $180.94 by 1990, an almost ninefold outperformance versus his peers and a more than twelvefold outperformance versus the S&P 500, leaving Jack Welch a distant speck in his rearview mirror.\n\nFIGURE 2-2\n\nTeledyne stock price during the Singleton era versus S&P 500 and peers\n\n\n\na. Adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, and cash dividends (assumed to be reinvested and taxed at 40 percent).\n\nb. Comparable conglomerates include Litton Industries, ITT, Gulf & Western, and Textron.\n\nThe Nuts and Bolts\n\nOne of the most important decisions any CEO makes is how he spends his time—specifically, how much time he spends in three essential areas: management of operations, capital allocation, and investor relations. Henry Singleton’s approach to time management was, not surprisingly, very different from peers like Tex Thornton and Harold Geneen and very similar to his fellow outsider CEOs.\n\nAs he told Financial World magazine in 1978, “I don’t reserve any day-to-day responsibilities for myself, so I don’t get into any particular rut. I do not define my job in any rigid terms but in terms of having the freedom to do whatever seems to be in the best interests of the company at any time.”9 Singleton eschewed detailed strategic plans, preferring instead to retain flexibility and keep options open. As he once explained at a Teledyne annual meeting, “I know a lot of people have very strong and definite plans that they’ve worked out on all kinds of things, but we’re subject to a tremendous number of outside influences and the vast majority of them cannot be predicted. So my idea is to stay flexible.”10 In a rare interview with a BusinessWeek reporter, he explained himself more simply: “My only plan is to keep coming to work.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
