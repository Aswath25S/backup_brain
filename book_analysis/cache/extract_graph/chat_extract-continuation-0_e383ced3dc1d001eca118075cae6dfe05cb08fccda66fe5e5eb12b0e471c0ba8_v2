This price equaled a multiple of six times cash flow for HBJ’s core publishing assets, an attractive price relative to comparable transactions (Smith would eventually sell those businesses for eleven times cash flow). Table 7-1 outlines the sources and uses for the transaction, giving a sense for its complexity and the number of parties involved.\n\nFollowing the HBJ acquisition in 1991, General Cinema spun off its mature theater business into a separate publicly traded entity, GC Companies (GCC), allowing management to focus its attention on the larger retail and publishing businesses. Smith and his management team proceeded to operate both the retail and the publishing businesses over the next decade. In 2003, Smith sold the HBJ publishing assets to Reed Elsevier, and in 2006 he sold Neiman Marcus, the last vestige of the General Cinema portfolio, to a consortium of private equity buyers. Both transactions would set valuation records within their industries, capping an extraordinary run for Smith and General Cinema shareholders.\n\nTABLE 7-1\n\nFinancial data from General Cinema’s acquisition of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich\n\n\n\nSource: General Cinema/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich joint proxy statement, pp. 32, 40, 46–47.\n\nSmith, thrust unexpectedly into the CEO spot by his father’s death, posted extraordinary numbers over his forty-three years at the helm of General Cinema (see figure 7-1), generating a remarkable 16.1 percent compound annual return for his shareholders, dwarfing the 9 percent returns for the S&P and the 9.8 percent returns for GE over the same period. A dollar invested with Dick Smith at the beginning of 1962 would have been worth $684 at the end of the period. That same dollar invested in the S&P would have been worth $43, and $60 if invested with GE.\n\nThe Nuts and Bolts\n\nSmith evolved a distinctive approach to managing General Cinema’s operations. He ran the company in close collaboration with a coterie of three top executives: chief financial officer Woody Ives, chief operating officer Bob Tarr, and corporate counsel Sam Frankenheim. He officially designated this group the Office of the Chairman, or the OOC. The OOC met weekly, and Smith actively encouraged debate among his top executives. Longtime General Cinema investment banker Caesar Sweitzer characterized these sessions as “wrestling matches conducted in a constructive, collegial way.”4\n\nFIGURE 7-1\n\nTotal shareholder return dramatically exceeded the S&P 500 and comparables’ return\n\n\n\nTotal value of $1 invested in January 1962.a\n\nSource: Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP).\n\nNote: NMG was spun off to GC shareholders in October 1989, and Harcourt General was sold to Reed Elsevier in July 2001. In order to capture the return generated from the sale of NMG to TPG and Warburg Pincus in October 2005, assume that proceeds from the sale to Reed Elsevier are reinvested in a security whose value grows each year at the average growth of Leucadia and the S&P 500 for that year (Leucadia and S&P CAGR of 17.7% and 0.7% over the period of July 2001–October 2005).\n\na. Assumes that dividends (taxed at 35%) are reinvested upon receipt into common shares of the stock of the company.\n\nSmith was even willing to be outvoted by the other OOC members. Woody Ives, the company’s talented CFO, remembers one of his proudest moments at General Cinema (Ives later left to lead a successful turnaround at Eastern Resources), when a joint venture to enter the cable business with Comcast and CBS was shot down by the board after Smith let Ives voice a dissenting opinion: “He gave me permission to publicly disagree with him in front of the Board. Very few CEOs would have done that.”5\n\nGeneral Cinema operated with a very lean corporate staff. The company had its corporate headquarters next to one of its theaters in the rear of a nondescript shopping mall in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. Smith proudly notes that this suburban office space was effectively rent free because the theater covered the rent expense for the entire complex. Smith delegated management of day-today operations to the OOC and the division heads, and spent little time on investor communications, which were “only adequate,” according to Putnam analyst Bob Beck.6 Instead, he spent the majority of his time on strategic and capital allocation issues.\n\nThe company was run very tightly by this small group of managers. David Wargo, a longtime media investor, shared a report with me that he wrote following a meeting with management immediately after the HBJ acquisition. What’s striking in the report is the crispness of the presentation: the clearly laid-out rationale for the deal and the accompanying list of specific benchmarks and return objectives, with no excess verbiage. What’s also noteworthy in hindsight is that the company hit or exceeded every one of its targets. As Wargo says of the General Cinema team, “It’s remarkable how much value can be created by a small group of really talented people.”7\n\nSmith, who had become CEO in his late thirties, was comfortable giving executives responsibility early in their careers.
